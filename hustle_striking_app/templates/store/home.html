     <p class="coach-bio">My name is Jalene Delsid and I am one of the instructors at
      Hustle Striking. I started off my martial arts career with jiu jitsu. I
      fell in love with the sport when I was 8 years old and have
      continued to love it to this day. I am a 3x National and a 4x World
      champion in jiu-jitsu. At 12 years old, I started boxing. I am now
      an active amateur boxer and inspiring future olympian. I also have
      experience in Muay Thai and Kickboxing. I train at 2x former
      world champion James “Buddy” Mcgirts boxing gym with my
      coach Ivan Castaneda. He trains multiple pro fighters and I am
      blessed to be learning from him and the fighters. I love being a
      trainer at Hustle striking so I can bring out the joy in everybody
      and push them beyond their limits, in and out the gym.</p>

     <p class="coach-bio">My name is Momotaro Tachibe and I am a coach at Hustle Striking. I started my martial
      arts journey when I was 8 years old with Taekwondo at International Taekwondo. There,
      I fell in love with the training and discipline of the art and have been a big fan of fighting
      since. After that my brother introduced me to boxing and I fell in love. Throughout
      highschool I focused on bodybuilding and boxing, going back and forth until I went to
      college. After graduating from UCLA with a Philosophy degree, I came back home to an
      opportunity from Sam Hakimi to become a coach at Hustle Striking. Since then I have
      dedicated my time to truly learning and understanding the art of boxing, and how to
      teach it to others. As a coach my goal is to show my students and clients the mental
      and physical discipline it takes to be a boxer and have it extend to their everyday
      lifestyle.</p>

     <p class="coach-bio">My name is Sam Hakimi, and I am the head coach and founder of Hustle
      Striking. I’ve been training in martial arts since I was 11 years old at Team Karate
      Centers, under Master Fariborz Azakh. There, I earned my second degree black
      belt in Hapkido Blend and became the head instructor of the junior program at 16
      years of age. Master Fariborz blessed me with the opportunity of being able to
      teach over a thousand students. I am forever grateful for the blessing he gave
      me, and knowledge to open up Hustle Striking. At around the same time, from
      ages 16-20, I trained with the legendary Benny “The Jet” Urquidez and Peter
      “Sugarfoot” Cunningham. Working with these two Legends in the sport of
      kickboxing gave me a solid foundation in my striking. Sparring and training with
      Sensei Peter’s fighters like German Baltazar and Shawn Yacobian at such a
      young age gave me a great advantage in terms of hand to hand combat. From
      there, I gradually focused on boxing by training with Bernie Hopalian. A
      combination of all of these different arts from Hapkido, kickboxing and boxing and
      knowledge from all these great mentors is what I try to pass on to the students at
      Hustle Striking.</p>
